# PriceChecker (work in progress)
This is my first time trying out web scraping. I'm checking the prices of items that I'm interested in to see if their price has changed.

Things that need to be installed: selenium, google chrome driver
I'm using vscode, and I installed selenium by typing in "pip install selenium" into the cmd in vscode.
The website for google chrome drivers is: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
Download the one that matches your Google Chrome version. Although my system and Google Chrome is 64-bit, I downloaded the 32-bit version for Windows and it works fine.
